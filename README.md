# Segmenting-and-Clustering-Neighborhoods-in-Toronto

The repository is a part of the IBM Data Science Capstone project. The project includes the segmentation and clustering of Neighbourhoods in Toronto using 
K Means Machine Learning Clustering algorithm.

The first map contains the visualization of the various neighbourhoods in Canada whose borough has the word Toronto.

Then we'll use KMEAN algorithm and elbow method for finding the best K and make a new map that will show the results of the clustering:
